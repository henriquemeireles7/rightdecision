# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- BD Podcast Distribution Pipeline: 7-step automated pipeline from video to social posts
- Skill-driven AI architecture: zero API keys, all AI runs in user's Claude Code subscription
- 4 providers: storage (R2), transcription (Whisper), social-posting (Upload-Post), social-analytics
- 7 feature endpoints: transcribe, clip-select, clip-cut, metadata-generate, post-distribute, analytics-collect, insight-generate
- 5 Claude Code skills: /process-episode, /select-clips, /generate-metadata, /whats-working, /collect-analytics
- Seed script for 13 platform accounts across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X, YouTube
- Auth middleware on all BD pipeline routes
- Atomic CAS on all pipeline state transitions (race condition prevention)
- Transaction wrapping for clip-select and metadata-generate operations
- Retry with backoff on Upload-Post API calls (429/503 handling)
- Subprocess safety: concurrent stdout/stderr reads prevent pipe deadlock
- ffmpeg timeout (5 min per clip) prevents hung processes
- S3 NoSuchKey properly maps to 404 for video-not-found detection
- Path traversal prevention on R2 object keys

### Changed
- Removed ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env.ts (skill-driven architecture, no AI API calls from server)
- Replaced AI_FAILED error codes with VALIDATION_FAILED (server receives results, doesn't call AI)
